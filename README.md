# Codenames (Clone)

Codenames is a 2015 card game for 4–8 players designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games Edition. Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game))

We made a clone of this board game using Spring Boot and React.js.
